\chapter{References}

the {\sc Bib}\TeX\ tool is employed for citing references and creating bibliography. The referencing style is \verb|ieeetr|. The references are kept in the \verb|Bibliography.bib| file and the \verb|\cite| command should be use for the citation. Here is an example of single citation \cite{einstein} and multiple citations \cite{latexcompanion,knuthwebsite}.
